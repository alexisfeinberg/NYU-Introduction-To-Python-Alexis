# Response to Step 4 - Is there another way to solve this problem?

While the first part of the homework asked for lists, I used a dictionary in response to Part 4.

## Pros:
* Dictonaries were more functional than using two lists because if I wanted to add in, for example, 'DC' to both lists, I would have to make sure I was on line 13 for both.
This could lead to errors. 

## Con:
* However, dictionaries donâ€™t preserve order. This wasn't an issue when I ran the code, but I can imagine there are instances when it would be an issue. 
  ** Question: Is there a way to maintain order? Or make it output an alphabetical order?
  
## Something else I learned:
 * From this homework, I also wanted to make a tab and came across '\t' - so useful!
